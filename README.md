# python
This repository will act as a showcase of my Python learnings. Rather than solely showcasing entire projects, I want this repo to serve as a timeline of micro-learnings I attain in Python. This ranges from Python scripts, small automations, etc.

# Format
The files in this repo will not necessarily follow a structure. The reason for this is to match my particular learning style for Python. With Python, I found that creating many different scripts and solutions for different purposes was better for my learning compared to building out an entire project to begin with.
So, following this approach, expect to see many unrelated files in this repo that perform wildly different things, like small Python scripts to read from files, scripts that perform basic data analysis, small scripts for creating and working with AI agents, etc.
